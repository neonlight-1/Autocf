//Automatically fetches the next Codeforces problem after you solve one. Choose your preferred rating range and stay focused on one problem at a time.

 Codeforces Problem Feeder

What This Is:

This project is made for people who want to get better at Codeforces without getting distracted or overwhelmed.

Here’s how it works:  
You get a problem to solve. Once you solve it, only then do you get the next one. That’s it—simple and focused.

Why It's Useful:

- You can choose the difficulty range (based on problem ratings).
- You’ll only get a new problem after solving the current one—no jumping around.
- It’s great for building discipline and staying in the zone.

How to Use It:

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Set your desired rating range.
3. Run the script and start solving.
4. Once your solution is accepted, the next problem shows up automatically.

What’s Next:

- Keeping track of the problems you’ve already solved.
- Better integration with Codeforces using their API.
- Maybe even a cool interface in the future.
